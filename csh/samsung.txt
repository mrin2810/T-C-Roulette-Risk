WELCOME

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in our services.


We, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“we”, “our”, or “Samsung”), together with our affiliates, provide a variety of features, apps, and services that you can enjoy with our mobile devices, TVs, and other products, listed here (“Services”), and these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) will cover your use of the Services.


ACCEPTING OUR TERMS

By creating an account or using our Services, you confirm that you accept these Terms. You may only agree to these Terms if you have reached 18 years of age. Minors (under the age of 18) who are not prevented, banned, or otherwise unable to use the Services under the applicable law and regulation in your jurisdiction must have a legal guardian’s permission to create a Samsung account and agree to these Terms. Minors may be prevented from creating an account or using certain Services due to our children accessibility policy in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. If you are a Minor, you also confirm that you have reviewed these Terms with your legal guardian before using the Services, and that you and your legal guardian understand and consent to these Terms. If you are a legal guardian and you allow your Minor to create a Samsung account and use the Services, then these Terms apply to you, and you are responsible for your Minor’s activities on the Services. Please see the Child Account section of these Terms for more information about accounts created by legal guardians of Minors under 13 years of age.

We may sometimes need to change these Terms. We will let you know of any changes by posting the updated Terms on our website. If we think the changes are material, we may send a notification to the email address linked to your Samsung account before the updated Terms become effective. If you do not agree to the changes, you may stop using our Services and delete your Samsung account. By continuing to use our Services after the updated Terms become effective, you confirm that you understand and accept the updated Terms.

These Terms of Service constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Samsung, including the terms and conditions regarding dispute resolution, set forth on the Governing Law/Dispute Resolution Section, below.

GOVERNING LAW/ DISPUTE RESOLUTION | The formation, existence, construction, performance, validity, and all aspects whatsoever of these Terms will be governed by the law of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of laws principles. These Terms will not be governed by the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court of competent jurisdiction.

ALL DISPUTES WITH SAMSUNG ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. Any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute involving service provided to any other person or entity, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or amount, the relief allowed by the applicable law. The arbitration shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes, and is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of interpretation and application of this arbitration provision and these Terms. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction.

This arbitration provision also applies to claims against our employees, representatives, and affiliates if any such claim arises from these Terms. For any arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, are $5,000.00 or less (“Small Claim”), the arbitrator may, if you prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and costs as part of any award, but may not grant us our attorney fees, expert witness fees, or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. In a Small Claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than half of the total administrative, facility, and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of such fees, whichever is less, and we shall pay the remainder of such fees. Administrative, facility, and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, exceed $5,000.00 (“Large Claim”) shall be determined according to AAA rules. In a Large Claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and costs to the extent allowed by the applicable law. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to us no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this Service Authorization. To opt out, you must send notice by email to optout@sea.samsung.com, with the subject line: “Arbitration Opt Out.” You must include in the opt out email (a) your name and address; (b) the date of this Service Authorization; (c) the model name or model number of your Device on which the applicable Service is used; and (d) the IMEI or MEID or Serial Numbers, as applicable, if you have them (the IMEI or MEID or Serial Numbers can be found (i) on the Product box; (ii) on the Product information screen, which can be found under “Settings;” (iii) on a label on the back of the Product beneath the battery, if the battery is removable; and (iv) on the outside of the Product if the battery is not removable). Alternatively, you may opt out by calling 1 800 SAMSUNG (726-7864) no later than 30 calendar days from the initial date of this Service and providing the same information. These are the only two forms of notice that will be effective to opt out of this dispute resolution procedure. Opting out of this dispute resolution procedure will not affect the Terms of Service, and you will continue to enjoy the benefits of the Terms of Service.
