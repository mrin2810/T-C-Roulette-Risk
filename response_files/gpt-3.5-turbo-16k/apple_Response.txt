{'Positive Response': '1. Family Sharing: The T&C introduces the Family Sharing feature, which allows eligible subscriptions and content to be shared among up to six family members. This can be advantageous for families as it allows them to share their purchases and subscriptions, reducing overall costs and providing access to a wider range of content.\n\n2. Content Usage Rules: The T&C outlines specific usage rules for different types of content, such as audio and video content, apps, and Apple Music. These rules ensure that users can enjoy the content on multiple devices, burn music to discs, and have access to their purchased content even if it is removed from the Services. These rules provide flexibility and convenience for users.\n\n3. Termination and Suspension of Services: The T&C states that Apple reserves the right to terminate or suspend the Services under certain circumstances. While this may initially seem disadvantageous, it can actually be beneficial for users as it allows Apple to take action against fraudulent or abusive behavior, ensuring a safer and more reliable user experience for everyone.', 'Negrative Response': '1. Automatic Updates of Payment Information: The T&C states that Apple may automatically update your payment information without your explicit consent. This can be potentially harmful as it gives Apple the authority to make changes to your payment methods without your knowledge or control.\n\n2. Limited Access to Content: The T&C mentions that Apple reserves the right to remove or discontinue certain content from the Services at any time. This can be disadvantageous to users who have purchased or subscribed to specific content, as they may lose access to it without any prior notice or compensation.\n\n3. Lack of Liability for Unavailable Content: According to the T&C, Apple does not guarantee the availability of content and will not be liable if content becomes unavailable for download, redownload, or streaming. This can be problematic for users who rely on certain content for their personal or professional needs, as they may not have any recourse if the content they need becomes inaccessible.\n\n'}
