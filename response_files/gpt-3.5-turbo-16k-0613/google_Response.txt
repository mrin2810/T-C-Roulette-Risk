Age requirements: The T&C states that if you\'re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\'s permission to use a Google Account. While this is a reasonable requirement for minors, it can be potentially harmful if parents or guardians are not adequately informed about the implications of their child\'s online activities. It may lead to privacy concerns and potential misuse of personal information.\n\n2. Permission to use your content: The T&C mentions that by using Google services, you grant Google permission to use your content. While it states that your content remains yours, there is a possibility that Google may use your content for purposes such as promoting their services without explicit consent. This raises concerns about the control and ownership of user-generated content.\n\n3. Warranty disclaimer: The T&C includes a warranty disclaimer stating that Google provides its services "as is" without any express or implied warranties. This means that Google does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability of their services to meet your needs.
