{'Positive Response': '1. What you can expect from us: Discord aims to bring people together and provide a platform for shared experiences. This emphasis on community and belonging creates a positive environment for users to connect with others who share similar interests.\n\n2. Your Discord account: The T&C highlights the importance of account security and provides recommendations for protecting user accounts, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication. This focus on security benefits users by helping them safeguard their personal information.\n\n3. Services "AS IS": Discord acknowledges that their services are provided "as is" and disclaims any warranties. While this may seem disadvantageous, it also sets realistic expectations for users and avoids false promises. It ensures transparency and honesty in the service provided by Discord.', 'Negrative Response': "1. Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians: While it's important to protect minors, the T&C puts the burden on parents and legal guardians to agree to the terms on behalf of their children. This could potentially lead to a lack of control and oversight over their child's activities on Discord.\n\n2. Content in Discord's services: The T&C states that Discord is not responsible for others' use of your content. This could be disadvantageous as it puts the onus on users to protect their own content and leaves them vulnerable to unauthorized use or exploitation by other users.\n\n3. Termination: Discord reserves the right to suspend or terminate user accounts without notice, at their discretion. This lack of transparency and potential for sudden termination could be harmful to users who rely on Discord for communication and community-building.\n\n"}
