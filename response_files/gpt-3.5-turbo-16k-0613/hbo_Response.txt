{'Positive Response': "1. Age and Location Restrictions: The T&C clearly states that the service is intended for adults who are residents of the United States. This can be advantageous to users as it ensures that the content and services provided are appropriate and accessible to the target audience.\n\n2. Copyright and Trademark Protection: The T&C emphasizes the protection of copyrights and trademarks, both for HBO's content and for third-party content. This can be beneficial to users as it helps safeguard intellectual property rights and encourages a fair and legal use of the service.\n\n3. Moderation and Monitoring: The T&C grants HBO the right to monitor and moderate user-submitted content. This can be advantageous to users as it helps maintain a safe and appropriate environment within the service, protecting users from offensive or harmful material.", 'Negrative Response': "1. Waivers of Rights: The T&C includes waivers of rights, which means that by agreeing to the terms, users may be giving up certain legal rights. This can be disadvantageous as it limits the user's ability to seek legal recourse in the event of a dispute.\n\n2. Limitation of Liability: The T&C also includes a limitation of liability clause, which means that HBO may not be held fully responsible for any loss or damage incurred by the user while using the service. This can be harmful to the user as it reduces HBO's accountability for any potential harm caused.\n\n3. Use of Arbitration: The T&C requires the use of arbitration to resolve disputes, rather than going to court. This can be disadvantageous to the user as arbitration may not provide the same level of legal protection and remedies as a court or jury trial would.\n\n"}
