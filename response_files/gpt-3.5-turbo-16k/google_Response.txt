Age requirements: The T&C states that if you\'re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\'s permission to use a Google Account.

It may lead to privacy concerns and potential misuse of personal information.\n\n2. Permission to use your content: The T&C mentions that by using Google services, you grant Google permission to use your content. While it states that your content remains yours, there is a possibility that Google may use your content for purposes such as publishing, modifying, or creating derivative works based on it. This can raise concerns about the control and ownership of your intellectual property rights.\n\n3.
